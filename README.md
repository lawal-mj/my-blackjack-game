# My-blackjack-game
A black jack game I created


# Explanation
Basically, this is a toned down version of the game, all that matters here is that you win by getting 21, you draw another card by getting less than 21 and you lose the game by getting above 21. In the first and last instance, you'll have to start again as the drawing of a new card will be disabled. Of course, you'll get two default cards at the beginning.
